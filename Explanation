####    AT FIRST DATASET    ####

1. Data Preparation
Loading the Dataset: The data have been loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Feature Selection: Features were selected as independent variables (X), and the dependent variable (likely engine RPM) was chosen as y.
Data Splitting: The data was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split, with a specific test size (often 20-30%) and a random state for reproducibility.

2. Model Implementation
The following regression models were implemented:

Linear Regression:
The linear regression model was fitted to the training data (X_train and y_train).
Predictions were made on the testing data (X_test).

Random Forest Regression:
A random forest model was built using multiple decision trees.
The modelâ€™s predictions were generated, and results were stored for comparison.

3. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) were calculated for each model. These metrics help assess the accuracy and consistency of the predictions.
Comparison: The models compared based on the above metrics to determine which one performed best.

4. Visualization
Scatter plots were generated to compare actual vs. predicted values for each model.
A line representing perfect predictions (diagonal line) was plotted to visualize deviations in predictions.
A grid and legend were included for better interpretation.

####    AT SECOND DATASET    ####

1. Dataset Loading and Exploration
Loaded the dataset using pandas to analyze its structure.
Checked for missing values and understood column types.
Identified potential target and feature columns for analysis.
Purpose: This helps understand the structure of the dataset, identify columns with missing data, and get a first look at the content.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Dropped columns with too many missing values:
Threshold: Columns with more than 50% missing values were removed.
Imputed missing values:
Remaining missing values were filled with the mean of each column.
Removed non-informative columns:
Columns like IDs, timestamps, and constant columns with no variation were dropped.
Purpose: Cleaning the data ensures that the dataset is ready for analysis, with no significant missing or irrelevant values.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Heatmap:
Plotted a heatmap to analyze how features correlate with each other and with the target variable.
Scatter Plot Check:
We created scatter plots to visualize relationships between individual features and the target variable.
Purpose:
The heatmap identifies features that are strongly correlated with the target.
Scatter plots help to check the relationship type (linear/non-linear), which informs model choice.

4. Feature and Target Selection
Selected the target column (vehicle_speed in this case).
Defined the remaining columns as features.
Purpose: This step sets up the data for training the machine learning model.

5. Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Used an 80-20 split: 80% for training, 20% for testing.
Purpose: Splitting ensures that the model is trained on one subset of data and tested on another unseen subset to check performance.

6. Model Training: Random Forest
Trained a Random Forest Regressor model, a robust machine learning algorithm suitable for non-linear and complex relationships.
Why Random Forest?:
Random Forest handles non-linearity, missing values, and feature interactions well.
It reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees.

7. Model Prediction and Evaluation
Predicted the target variable on the test set.
Calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure model performance.
Purpose: MSE is a standard metric to evaluate regression models. A lower MSE indicates better predictions.

8. Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot
Plotted a scatter plot of actual vs predicted values with a red line showing "perfect predictions."
Purpose:
The closer the points are to the red line, the better the model's predictions.
This plot visually evaluates the model's accuracy.
