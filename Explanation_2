####    AT THIRD DATASET    ####

1. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values:
Columns with more than 50% missing values were identified and dropped.
Remaining missing values in numerical columns were filled with the column's mean.
Dropping Irrelevant Columns:
Columns such as bulk_id, car_reg_no, time_stamp, latitude, and longitude were deemed irrelevant and removed from the dataset.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Heatmap:
A heatmap of the correlation matrix was generated to visualize relationships between numerical variables.
Distribution Plots:
Histograms were created for key numerical features: vehicle_speed, engine_rpm, calculated_engine_load, and mass_air_flow_rate.
Scatter Plots:
Relationships between vehicle_speed and other key features were analyzed through scatter plots.

3. Feature Selection
The target variable was identified as vehicle_speed.
Remaining columns were used as features.

4. Data Splitting
The data was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) using train_test_split.

5. Data Standardization
Features were standardized using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

6. Model Training
Linear Regression Model:
Trained using the standardized training data.
Performance was evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² score.

Random Forest Regressor:
Trained as an alternative model to compare results with Linear Regression.
Similar performance metrics (RMSE and R² score) were calculated.

7. Model Evaluation
Linear Regression Results:
RMSE: 11.639
R² Score: 0.573
Accuracy: 57.29%

Random Forest Results:
RMSE: 7.227
R² Score: 0.835
Accuracy: 83.53%
Visualization:
Scatter plots of actual vs. predicted vehicle_speed were created for both models.

####    AT FOURTH DATASET    ####

1. Data Overview
Explored the dataset with .head(), .info(), and .describe() to understand its structure, including 41 columns and 31,671 rows.

2. Missing Data Analysis
Identified columns with a significant amount of missing values.
Dropped columns with more than 50% missing data and imputed missing values in the remaining columns with their mean for numerical features.

3. Data Cleaning
Removed irrelevant columns like bulk_id, car_reg_no, and time_stamp.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
a. Feature Distribution
Visualized the distributions of various features using histograms to understand their spread.

b. Correlation Analysis
Computed and visualized the correlation matrix to identify relationships among variables.

5. Predictive Modeling:
a. Target and Features
Defined the target variable (vehicle_speed) and independent features.

b. Data Splitting
Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training and 20% testing).

c. Feature Scaling
Standardized the features using StandardScaler for better performance in machine learning models.

d. Model Training
Used a RandomForestRegressor to predict vehicle speed.
Trained the model with 100 estimators and a random state of 0.

5. Model Evaluation:
a. Predictions
Predicted the vehicle speed on the test set.

b. Performance Metrics
Evaluated the model using:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 7.80
R-squared (R²): 0.8013 (80.13% of variance explained).

c. Visual Analysis
Compared actual vs. predicted values with scatter plots.
Highlighted the ideal fit line.

6. Feature Importance:
Visualized the importance of each feature in the prediction model.
Identified critical predictors like throttle position and engine load.
