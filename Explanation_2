####    AT THIRD DATASET    ####

1. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values:
Columns with more than 50% missing values were identified and dropped.
Remaining missing values in numerical columns were filled with the column's mean.
Dropping Irrelevant Columns:
Columns such as bulk_id, car_reg_no, time_stamp, latitude, and longitude were deemed irrelevant and removed from the dataset.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Heatmap:
A heatmap of the correlation matrix was generated to visualize relationships between numerical variables.
Distribution Plots:
Histograms were created for key numerical features: vehicle_speed, engine_rpm, calculated_engine_load, and mass_air_flow_rate.
Scatter Plots:
Relationships between vehicle_speed and other key features were analyzed through scatter plots.

3. Feature Selection
The target variable was identified as vehicle_speed.
Remaining columns were used as features.

4. Data Splitting
The data was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) using train_test_split.

5. Data Standardization
Features were standardized using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

6. Model Training
Linear Regression Model:
Trained using the standardized training data.
Performance was evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² score.

Random Forest Regressor:
Trained as an alternative model to compare results with Linear Regression.
Similar performance metrics (RMSE and R² score) were calculated.

7. Model Evaluation
Linear Regression Results:
RMSE: 11.639
R² Score: 0.573
Accuracy: 57.29%

Random Forest Results:
RMSE: 7.227
R² Score: 0.835
Accuracy: 83.53%
Visualization:
Scatter plots of actual vs. predicted vehicle_speed were created for both models.
